<div> Measurements analysis</div><div><i>UV Index:&nbsp;</i>We developed a code in&nbsp;<code>Python</code> to process the hourly averages UV Index, 24 hours per day, 365 days a year, along two decades. Hereinafter, we refer to hourly averages simply as UV Index unless otherwise specified. The script identify the maximum UV index and ignore the empty spaces and invalid values product of the maintenance of the equipments. The algorithm creates a matrix with the maximum UV Index (<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(UVI_{\max}\)</span>) values sorted by date, hour, years. Thereupon, it calculates the averages according to the scan on the different time scales as well as&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(UVI_{\max}\)</span>&nbsp;recorded in all network and all period. In particular,  the values from 11h to 14h LT&nbsp;were isolated to computed the daily averages around solar noon and the absolute maximums.</div><div><i>Aerosol Optical Dept:</i> The AOD<sub>340</sub>&nbsp; data were selected the annual averages with 7 months or more of continuous measurements. </div><div><i>Criteria pollutant</i>: In particular,  the values from 11h to 14h LT&nbsp;were isolated to computed the daily averages at solar noon and the absolute maximums.</div><div>For this purpose, we analyse the Radiative Cloud Factor measurements provides by the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI). The Cloud Factor comes from dataset of OMTO3 v8.5, Collection 3 and L2 quality. The Cloud Factor (dimensionless ) is represented in scale from 0 to 1 for the cloudless days and overcast sky, respectively.</div><div>The 1,461 observations that were selected from TOMS-EP/NASA correspond to the years 2000 to 2003 and OMI-Aura/NIVR-FMI-NASA data to the years 2004 to 2019, both dataset covering the complete time series of the ground-measurements.</div><div></div><h1 data-label="249401" class="ltx_title_section">Results and Discussion</h1><div>The daily&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(UVI_{\max}\)</span> were selected between 11:00 h-14:00 h LT from all ground-based measurements over MCMA. A counter as an extension of the code was executed, to quantify these maximum values and the percentage of the days in the period 2000 to 2019. The results indicated that, from a total of 7,305 days of continuous measurements,&nbsp;the daily&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(UVI_{max}\)</span> reached values between 6 and 9 the 62.37% of the days (Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{929259}</span>). The highest UV Index values were in the 13-14 range, being their total percentage frequency less than 1%.</div>
