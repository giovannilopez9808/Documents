<div>The SIMAT publishes a recommendation of protection according to the measured UVI.  In this way, it would be more convenient to estimate in term of SED/hr and then, to derive the exposure times. The&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(H_{er}\)</span> expressed as function of time can be obtained from UV Index as SED/hr=0.9UVI. As is indicated in Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{590688}</span>a, the interpolation of the UV Index (and corresponding SED/hr) at solar noon under clear sky, revels that these levels match better with the&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(UVI_{\max}\)</span> values measured over the network (see Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{931769}</span>) and the highest UV Index value of 12.6 (11.3 SED/hr) on June. Additionally, the SED/hr under all clear sky days were averaged for the three seasons: cold dry, warm dry and rainy, as is shown in Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{590688}</span>b. The warm dry and rainy seasons have a behavior almost coincident. Few data under clear sky were detected between September and October (one part of rainy season) being a negligible contribution on total average just when the UV Index decrease. Nevertheless, the daily asymmetries around solar noon shown in Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{358425}</span> could be caused by criteria gases and aerosol. An additional comparison between AOD ground-based measurements and derived data from model&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Palancar_2012,Castro_2001,Cabrera_2012}</cite>&nbsp;are needed to confirm this hypothesis.&nbsp;</div><div>As was mentioned in the Introduction, the phototypes III and IV are the most frequents in the Mexican inhabitants. The code in&nbsp;<code>Python</code>&nbsp;was executed to compute the accumulate doses&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(H_{er}\)</span>&nbsp;by means of Equation 2. Particularly, the solar exposure time as function of the local hour (considering only clear sky days in the period 2016-2018) were estimated for&nbsp;the skin types III and IV by means the repetitive operation until reach 3.0 SED and 4.5 SED, respectively. The Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{276646}</span>&nbsp;illustrates the result of exposure time to accumulate the&nbsp;corresponding&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(H_{er}\)</span>&nbsp;for each phototype.</div>
