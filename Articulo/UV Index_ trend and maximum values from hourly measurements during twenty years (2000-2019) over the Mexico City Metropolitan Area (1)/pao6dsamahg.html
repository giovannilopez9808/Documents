<div>Satellite data</div><div>Measurements provided by the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI)&nbsp;on board of  AURA-NASA satellite and the Total&nbsp;Ozone&nbsp;Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) on board the Earth Probe (EP)-NASA satellite were used. OMI was created in a cooperation between the Netherlands Agency for Aerospace Programmes (NIVR), the Finnish Meteorological Institute (FMI) and NASA.  OMI (hereafter  OMI-Aura/NIVR-FMI-NASA) performs observations over a geographical dimension of 13 Ã— 24km<sup>2</sup> at nadir. For Mexico City, the satellite overpass time is between 19:00h - 21:00h UTC. The UV Index, Radiative Cloud Factor and Total Ozone Column were collected for the current study. The TOMS-EP/NASA satellite instrument was also considered to complet the  examined period. It is a version that precedes  OMI and it was retrieving&nbsp; the Total Ozone Column (TOC) from spectral UV measurements. &nbsp;</div><h1 data-label="833220" class="ltx_title_section">Measurements analysis</h1><div><i>Criteria pollutants</i><span>: The ground-based measurements of PM</span><sub>10</sub><span>, CO, O</span><sub>3</sub><span> and NO</span><sub>2</sub><span> from 11h to 14h LT&nbsp;were isolated to compute the daily averages at solar noon and the absolute maximums.</span></div><div><i>Aerosol Optical Dept:</i> The&nbsp;AERONET AOD<sub>340</sub>&nbsp;data Product Level 2.0 were selected.

The Cloud Factor is dimensionless, from 0 to 1 for the cloudless days and overcast sky, respectively. TOC data were obtained from TOMS-EP/NASA. The 1,461 observations were acquired of the: TOMS-EP/NASA instrument during the period 2000 to 2003 and OMI-Aura/NIVR-FMI-NASA data from 2004 to 2019, both dataset covering the complete time series of the ground-UV Index measurements.</div><div><i>UV Index:&nbsp;</i>We developed a general code in&nbsp;<code>Python</code> to process the hourly averages UV Index, 24 hours per day, 365 days a year, along two decades. Hereinafter, we refer to hourly averages simply as UV Index unless otherwise specified. The script identifies the maximum UV index and ignore the empty spaces and invalid values, product of the maintenance of the equipment. The algorithm creates a matrix with the maximum UV Index (<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(UVI_{\max}\)</span>) values sorted by date, hour and years. Thereupon, it calculates the averages according to the scan on the different time scales as well as&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(UVI_{\max}\)</span>&nbsp;recorded in all network and all period. In particular,  the values from 11h to 14h LT&nbsp;were isolated to compute the daily averages around solar noon and the absolute maximums. For UV Index measured from OMI-Aura/NIVR-FMI-NASA, we take into account all available daily values in the period 2000-2019 under the same specification of the Cloud Factor and TOC data.</div><h1 data-label="249401" class="ltx_title_section">Results and Discussion</h1><div>The daily&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(UVI_{\max}\)</span> were selected in the time interval 11:00 h-14:00 h LT from all ground-based measurements over MCMA. A counter as an extension of the code was executed, to quantify these maximum values and the percentage of the days in the period 2000-2019. The results indicated that, from a total of 7,305 days of continuous measurements,&nbsp;the daily&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(UVI_{max}\)</span> reached values between 6 and 9 the 62.37% of the days (Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{929259}</span>). The highest UV Index values were in the 13-14 range, being their total percentage frequency less than 1%.</div>
