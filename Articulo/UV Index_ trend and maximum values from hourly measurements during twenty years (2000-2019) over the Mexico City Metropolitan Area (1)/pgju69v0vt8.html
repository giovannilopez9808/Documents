<div>A fundamental issue is to establish the clouds influence on the mean UV Index values. C<span>loudy days are frequent almost all year in MCMA. The attenuation on&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(UVI_{\max}\)</span>&nbsp;by clouds could also be predominant out of the rainy period.&nbsp;However,&nbsp;a gap in our knowledge is to discriminate cloudy days only using hourly UV Index measured in situ. T</span>he Radiative Cloud Factor measurements by OMI-Aura/NIVR-FMI-NASA satellite instrument was extracted for the Mexico City coordinates. Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{573921}</span>a depicts the daily Cloud Factor (5844 observations) recorded from 2004 to 2019 period.  It revealed that cloud cover regularly appears in part of the warm dry and rainy seasons, and is frequent the rest of the months.&nbsp;</div><div>Moreover, to incorporate satellite information about the total ozone column (TOC) is fundamental for understanding the UV Index levels.  Regarding the cold dry period (December to February) TOMS-EP/NASA and OMI-Aura/NIVR-FMI-NASA instruments estimated the lowest clouds coverage as well as the lowest TOC (Figure <span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{573921}</span>b). Conversely, higher ozone levels were registered from April to September.&nbsp;</div>
