In the mid-1990s, two studies about UV solar irradiance measurements  in the Mexican Valley in periods shorter than 3 years were published. One of these studies suggested&nbsp;a significant attenuation on UV intensity due to tropospheric ozone, comparing measurements in downtown and outskirts of the Mexico City&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Acosta_2000}</cite>. Another study reported that Mexico City had lower ultraviolet fluxes (around 25.6% at noon and 50% in the afternoon) compared to Colima, a city placed at the same latitude and an almost pollution-free.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Galindo_1995}</cite>.  Up to now,  these works have been the only ones carried out  in this topic in the MCMA.</div>
