<div> &nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{2002}</cite> despite the high aerosols concentration and smog photochemistry products that affect the solar radiation reaching the surface&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Castro_2001,Palancar_2012}</cite>. The few articles existing about solar radiation have either been short-term studies or have not focused on health skin. In this work, a script in&nbsp;<code>Python</code>&nbsp;was created to analyze the complete database and the different scales of time (minute, hours, days, years and decades) the average and the maximum UV Index as well and its trend. One part of the script was extended to management and determination on the thereshold erythemal dose for each skin phototype. The levels of UV Index at noon in the period 2000&nbsp;to 2019 over MCMA had a trend of 0.64 % per year with respect to the mean.&nbsp;The trend is in line with the results published by J. Herman about erythemal irradiance from 1979 to 2008 derived from satellite trends (between -1.7% to 2.0% annual) in the latitudinal fringe of Mexico City&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Herman_2010}</cite>. The current analysis also point out to the contribution with the determination of the solar exposure time as a limit to avoid sunburn considering the 'typical' phototypes very likely on the inhabitants of the Mexico City. Regarding to skin color to define the sensibility, imprecise terminology such as 'ethnic skin' and 'Hispanic skin' accentuate the problem of sparse data and hides relevant characteristics. Even there are discrepances between the MED values considered for each phototype&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Cadet_2019,Lehmann_2019,Fitzpatrick1988,Pérez2014,Sanclemente_2008}</cite>. The definition of the colors gradient and the descriptive numbers associated to the phototypes should always be clare and specific. The values of the MED or threreshold erythemal dose for each phototype are fundamentals to awareness of the photoprotection. The photoprotection needs to be promoted with properly communication about risk and information about the prevention. This premise would helps to demystify the perception about fact that the darker skins can not have sunburn or are exempt to develop skin-cancer&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{b2006}</cite>.&nbsp;This study highlights the importance of knowing the UV Index levels and the maximum exposure times to avoid damage. The goverment advise may be accompanied by recommendations associated with typical customs own of the country, such as the use of hats and long-sleeved shirts when they work or perform recreational activities in outdoors conditions.</div><h1 data-label="667124" class="ltx_title_section">Acknowledgements</h1><div>The authors wishes to acknowledge the SEDEMA members, institution belongs to the Mexico City Government.
