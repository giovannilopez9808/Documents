<div>maximum absolutes for: all stations, all days, hours, during two decades. We make special focus on the temporal availability more than network spacial distribution. The maximum absolut value of the UV Index were collected by hour at all stations distributed over MCMA, along period 2000-2019. In this way, nearby 2,000,000 were processed. The results were the maximum UV Index values displayed in Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{931769}</span>.&nbsp;</div><div>The historical database comparison of the measurements in situ and satellite retrievals revealed that exist similarity between both set values around solar noon.&nbsp;The measurements of maximum UV Index suggest that satellite data estimates may be biased low for months from march to october, while appear to be somehow biased in winter months. The UV Index in situ for december and January are highest than satellite-derived. These discrepancies could be by the aerosol load, that is why an additional comparison between AOD ground-based measurements and data-derived from model&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Palancar_2012,Castro_2001,Cabrera_2012}</cite>&nbsp;are needed to confirm hypothesis.&nbsp;</div>
