<div>The UVI^{max}daily maximum values from historical database were selected for all ground-based measurements over MCMA. A counter into the scrip was executes to quantify the percentage of the days&nbsp;in the period 2000 to 2019 with a specific UV Index maximum. The results indicated that from total of 7,305 days of continuous measurements, the 62.37% of the days in whole period, the UV Index reached their maximum values between 6 and 9 (Figure <span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{929259}</span>). The highest UV Index values were 13 and 14, being their total percentage frequency less than 1%.</div>
