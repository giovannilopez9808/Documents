<div>Since the year 2000, UV radiometers installed at the SIMAT network stations have been measuring erythemally-weighted solar radiation. These instruments are Model 501-A manufactured by Solar Light Company (SCL) with sensors detecting  wavelengths between 280-400nm. The calibrations were carried out every year, using a reference sensor  by the same manufacture. Although at the beginning only a few stations were in operation and have been changing, currently 11 stations are recording solar erythemal irradiances, which are converted to UV Indices, as given in Equation 1. The station names are: Chalco (CHA),&nbsp;Cuautitlán (CUT), FES Acatlán (FAC), Hangares (HAN), Laboratorio de Análisis Ambiental (LAA), Merced (MER), Montecillo (MON), Milpa Alta (MPA), Pedregal (PED), San Agustín (SAG), Santa Fe (SFE), Centro de Ciencias de la Atmósfera (CCA) and&nbsp;Tlalnepantla (TLA). The radiometers of the SIMAT have been distributed over MCMA, prioritizing the sites with more density of population, as it is shown in Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{547698}</span> right. The coordinates of the stations conforming the&nbsp;radiometers  network are described in Table 2.  On the SIMAT website&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aire.cdmx.gob.mx/default.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://www.aire.cdmx.gob.mx/default.php</a>,&nbsp;UV Index measurements for each station are available almost in real time.&nbsp;</div><div>Even if there is no SLC radiometer at the station of the Centro de Ciencias de la Atmósfera (CCA) that belongs to the SIMAT, it has a photometer of the AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET see&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Holben_1998}</cite>). This instrument measures in situ the Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) at 340nm. Additionally, we include measurements from  the Automated Atmospheric Monitoring Network (Red Automática de&nbsp;Monitoreo Atmosférico, RAMA), a SIMAT subdivision, that is in charge of assessing the air quality. These dataset were used to perform a brief analysis about the criteria pollutants recorded by RAMA: Ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) and concentration of particles with diameter less or equal than 10 μm (PM<sub>10</sub>). The O<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;and NO<sub>2</sub> are reported&nbsp;in parts per billion (ppb), using ultraviolet photometry (Teledyne API model 400E) and chemiluminescence  (Teledyne-API model 200E) respectively. The CO in parts per million (ppm) is derived by absorption of infrared light in a correlation cell (Teledyne API model 300E) and PM<sub>10</sub>&nbsp;(in microgram per cubic meter) is measured by the beta attenuation method (Thermo Model 1405-DF FDMS).</div>
