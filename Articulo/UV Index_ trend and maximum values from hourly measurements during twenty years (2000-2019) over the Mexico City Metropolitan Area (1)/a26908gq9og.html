<div>subscript. All the empty spaces are ignored in the calculation as well as invalid values product of maintenance of the equipments. A null array is initialized with fixed rows-columns size corresponding to average hourly UVI values, 24 hours per day, 365 days a year, for every year in the&nbsp;past two decades.  Thereby, daily&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\overline{UVI}\)</span>&nbsp;values were hourly compared with&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(i\)</span>from 0h to 23h for each date and station.
