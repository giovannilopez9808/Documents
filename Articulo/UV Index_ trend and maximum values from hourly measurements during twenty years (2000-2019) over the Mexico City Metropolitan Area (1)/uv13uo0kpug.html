<div>Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{358425}</span> shows the diurnal variation of the UVI for several specific cloud-free days, for different seasons and several locations.  Although the stations are all within a 25 km radius, substantial differences among them are notable. The differences are particularly evident in the afternoons, suggesting that their origin is not related to calibration differences between the instruments.  Photographs of the locations also indicate that shadowing from nearby structures is not an issue.  It is more likely that local differences in air pollution, particularly aerosols, are the cause of this variability.  Previous studies (e.g.,&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Castro_2001,Palancar_2012}</cite>) have shown that surface UV radiation in Mexico City is attenuated significantly by aerosols.  The measurements shown in Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{358425}</span> are consistent with increasing pollution during the course of the day, with highest aerosol loading (and highest variability) attained in the afternoon.  Further support for the role of pollution in suppressing the UVI comes from the observation made at Santa Fe (SFE) which in Fig.&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{358425}</span> are seen to be systematically higher, e.g. by over 10% in autumn afternoons, compared to the other stations.  The SFE station is located at 3600 m asl, approximately 300 m higher than Mexico City, and so avoids a substantial fraction of the polluted MCMA boundary layer. It is expected to have higher values of the UVI, in agreement with the observations.</div>
