<div>exico City Metropolitan Area (MCMA) is one of the largest urban agglomeration in the world. It is placed in the intertropical region and high elevation (around 2200 m above sea level) and consequently UV index is expected to be quite high a large fraction of the year. In this work we present results of the analysis of more that …. . millions data of solar erythemal irradiance, registered for 11 stations of Secretary&nbsp; &nbsp;………………………… (CMDX, SEDEMA ?), ADRIANA: COMPLETAR from 2000 to 2019.   The UV index have maximum values in the range of 12-13 GIOVANNI: VERIFICAR all year round at 12:00 solar time, which is small in comparison with the values  registered in cities placed in similar geographical sites, essentially due to the high values of particulate matter and gases that attenuate solar radiation. Another important result is the large temporal extensión in hours and days of the UV index values equal or higher to 6 (i.e., qualified as High), been in the range 9-16 hours in the period February-November  and in the range …. -…….GIOVANNI: COMPLETAR hours for December-January.  The persistent high values of the UV index could have a possitive influence in the reduction of  the impact of infectious diseases, like coronavirus disease COVID-19. &nbsp;</div>
