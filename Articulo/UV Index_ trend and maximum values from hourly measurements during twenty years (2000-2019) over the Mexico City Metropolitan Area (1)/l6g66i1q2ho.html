<div>In January the median and mean UVI values are near 8 (see Fig.&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{443547}</span>b). However, the UVI values and SD seems to be flattened (in the range 10-11) from March to August and decreasing to November (rainy period) with a slight rise on December. The rather low monthly UV Index values, may be a consequence of averaging measurements in presence of clouds and/or significant pollution.  Both depend on time of the year, with a cool dry season from November to February, warm dry March-April-May, and a rainy season from&nbsp;June to October.  In addition to urban aerosol pollution sources, biomass burning for agriculture and wood cooking also contribute to poor air quality in the MCMA&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Retama_2015}</cite>. In the warm season, faster photochemical oxidant formation, dust, and biomass burning all contribute to strong aerosol loading. In rainy months, UV Index values are lower due to the presence of clouds.&nbsp;</div>
