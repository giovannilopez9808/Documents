<div>Since the year 2000, the biometers installed in the weather stations network of SIMAT have been measuring erythemally-weighted UV solar radiation (MED/hr). These instruments are Model 501-A manufactured by Solar Light Company with sensors detecting between wavelengths between 280nm and 400nm. The calibrations were carried out every year&nbsp;using a reference sensor of the same factory. Although at the beginning only a few stations were in operation, currently 11 stations are recording solar erythemal irradiance, which multiplied by a factor are converted to UV Index. The radiometers of SIMAT have been distributed over MCMA prioritizing the sites with more density of population. The coordinates of the stations conforming the&nbsp;radiometers  network is described in Table&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{139544}</span> On the SIMAT website&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aire.cdmx.gob.mx/default.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://www.aire.cdmx.gob.mx/default.php</a>&nbsp;is available UV Index measurements for one station almost in real time.&nbsp;</div><div>Mexico City has a temperate climate,   its period of increased cloudiness or wet season  is from May to November, although the rainfall is highest between June and August. It must be pointed out that Mexico City has daylight saving time, where the Local Time (<i>LT</i>) depending on the early spring or autumn and it is result from the subtraction of 5 or 6 hours of the Coordinated Universal Time (<i>UTC</i>). In this work, we used&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(LT=\left(UTC-6\right)h\)</span><i>&nbsp;</i>to simplify the analysis.&nbsp;</div><div></div>
