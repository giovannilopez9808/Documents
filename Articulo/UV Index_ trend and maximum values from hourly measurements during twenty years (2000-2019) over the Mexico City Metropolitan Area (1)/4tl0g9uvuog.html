<div>As was mentioned in the Introduction, the phototypes III and IV are the most frequents in Mexican inhabitants. The code in&nbsp;<code>Python</code>&nbsp;was executed to compute the accumulate doses&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(H_{er}\)</span>&nbsp;by means of Equation 2. Particularly, the solar exposure time as function of the local hour (considering only clear sky days in the period 2016-2018) were estimated for&nbsp;the skin types III and IV by means the repetitive operation until reach 3.0 SED and 4.5 SED, respectively. Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{276646}</span>&nbsp;illustrates the result of exposure time to accumulate the&nbsp;corresponding&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(H_{er}\)</span>&nbsp;for each phototype.</div>
