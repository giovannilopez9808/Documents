<div>A fundamental issue is to identify the impact of clouds on the mean UV Index values.  However,&nbsp;a gap in our knowledge is to discriminate cloudy days, due to a lack in ground-base information. Currently, it is still a challenge area to define an optimal cloud filter to isolate the data at the attenuation moment and take into account the rest of values for the statistical analysis.&nbsp;</div><div>A widely used alternative is to examine the Radiative Cloud Factor measurements carried out by the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI). OMI was created in a cooperation between the Netherlands Agency for Aerospace Programmes (NIVR), the Finnish Meteorological Institute (FMI) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). On board Aura satellite, OMI (hereafter  OMI-Aura/NIVR-FMI-NASA) performs observations over a dimension of 13 × 24km<sup>2</sup> at nadir. For Mexico City, the satellite overpass time is between 19:00h - 21:00h UTC&nbsp;and the coordinates are Lat: 19.42°,&nbsp; Lon: -99.12° and Alt: 2,245 m a.s.l. The Cloud Factor comes from dataset of OMTO3 v8.5, Collection 3 and L2 quality. The Cloud Factor (dimensionless ) is represented in scale from 0 to 1 for the cloudless days and overcast sky, respectively. Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{573921}</span>a depicts the daily Cloud Factor (5,844 observations) recorded from 2004 to 2019 period.  It revealed an extensive cloud cover in the months from May to November, that regularly appears within the rainy period. Instead, the clouds presence   was less frequent the rest of the year.&nbsp;</div><div>Moreover, to incorporate satellite information about the Total Ozone Column (TOC) is fundamental for understanding the UV Index levels.  Total&nbsp;Ozone&nbsp;Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) on board Earth Probe (EP)-NASA satellite, was an instrument retrieving&nbsp; the TOC from spectral UV measurements. The 1,461 observations that were selected from TOMS-EP/NASA correspond to the years 2000 to 2003 and OMI-Aura/NIVR-FMI-NASA data to the years 2004 to 2019, both dataset covering the complete time series of the ground-measurements.&nbsp;Regarding the dry period (December to March) these instruments estimated the lowest clouds coverage as well as the lowest TOC. Conversely, the abundant ozone levels was registered from April to September.&nbsp;</div>
