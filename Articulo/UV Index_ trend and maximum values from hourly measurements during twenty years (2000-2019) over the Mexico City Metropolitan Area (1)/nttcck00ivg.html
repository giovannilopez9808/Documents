<div><span></span><i>Cloud Factor and Total Ozone Column</i>:  we analyse the Radiative Cloud Factor and TOC derived from OMI-Aura/NIVR-FMI-NASA, for the OMTO3 v8.5 dataset, Collection 3 and L2 quality. The Cloud Factor is dimensionless in scale from 0 to 1 for the cloudless days and overcast sky, respectively. For TOC data were also acquired from TOMS-EP/NASA. The 1,461 observations that were selected from TOMS-EP/NASA correspond to the years 2000 to 2003 and OMI-Aura/NIVR-FMI-NASA data to the years 2004 to 2019, both dataset covering the complete time series of the ground-measurements.</div><h1 data-label="249401" class="ltx_title_section">Results and Discussion</h1><div>The daily&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(UVI_{\max}\)</span> were selected between 11:00 h-14:00 h LT from all ground-based measurements over MCMA. A counter as an extension of the code was executed, to quantify these maximum values and the percentage of the days in the period 2000 to 2019. The results indicated that, from a total of 7,305 days of continuous measurements,&nbsp;the daily&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(UVI_{max}\)</span> reached values between 6 and 9 the 62.37% of the days (Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{929259}</span>). The highest UV Index values were in the 13-14 range, being their total percentage frequency less than 1%.</div>
