<div>The UV Index is a measure of the risk of suffering erythema from short-term solar exposure.  Mexico City is one of the most populated cities in the world, and could experience large exposures due to its location at 2240 m above sea level, and its intertropical latitude. In the present study&nbsp;we analyzed around 2 million ground-based UV Index measurements from the Secretariat of the Environment of the Mexico City Government during two decades (2000-2019)  over the Mexico City Metropolitan Area. An increasing trend in the  UV Index, of 0.66 % per year was found. Trends in criteria pollutants PM<sub>10</sub>, CO, NO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub> and in AOD<sub>340</sub>&nbsp;were also estimated. The monthly mean UV Index value at solar noon reaches barely 10.5 under all sky conditions, along the year.&nbsp; UV Index data derived from OMI-Aura/NIVR-FMI-NASA measurements of ozone and clouds ranged between 6.4 and 14.9. The UV Index was used to estimate the Standard Erythema Dose (SED) per hour for high sun under clear sky conditions, and from these we estimate exposure times as a limit to avoid sunburn for typical skin phototypes (III and IV of the Fitzpatrick classification)  in Mexico City. These results may be helpful to design preventive public health campaigns that target groups with typical phototypes of the inhabitants of the Mexico City.</div>
