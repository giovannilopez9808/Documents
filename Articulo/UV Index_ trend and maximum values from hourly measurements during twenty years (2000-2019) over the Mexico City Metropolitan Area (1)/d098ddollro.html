<div>.he aerosols, O<sub>3</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub>, gases that attenuate of solar UV radiation.   Palancar et al. (2012) reported that the aerosol presence plays a major part in the diminishing of the UV radiation&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Palancar_2012}</cite>. Thus, aerosol is likely the main responsible for generating the asymmetry in the intensity around solar noon and the differences of UV Index measurements in clear sky conditions over neighbourhood stations.&nbsp;</div>
