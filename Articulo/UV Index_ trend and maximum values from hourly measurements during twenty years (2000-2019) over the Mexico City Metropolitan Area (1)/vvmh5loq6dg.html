<div>he monthly UV Index values may be rather low as consequence of the averaging of measurements in presence of clouds or atmospheric pollution.&nbsp;Policies aimed on the improvement of air quality simultaneously with urban and industrial development have taken place in the last years&nbsp;\cite{figueroa2009}. It was also established that, besides urban aerosol pollution sources, biomass burning  from agricultural, forest, wood cooking and trash burning, also contributes to the pollution in the MCMA&nbsp;\cite{Parrish_2011}. Stephens et al (2008) determined the monthly variation of the concentrations of PM10 in the morning (between 7h and 12h) and O3 in the afternoon (from 11h to 17h) for the years 2001–2007. The mean values were: 81 µg/m3 for PM10 and 83 ppb for O3&nbsp;\cite{Stephens_2008}.For the purpose of assessing the impact of PM10, CO, NO2, O3&nbsp;in the UV Index, we processed the measurements made with ground-based instruments in the same stations where UV Index was recorded. To recognize the individual contributions of PM10, CO, NO2, O3&nbsp;were calculated the annual averages base on daily measurements from 11h to 14h LT. The trends determined from de linear fit are:&nbsp;-0.1196, -0.0835,&nbsp;&nbsp;-1.04,&nbsp;-1.046 %/year of  PM10, CO, NO2, O3&nbsp;respectively.&nbsp;</div>
