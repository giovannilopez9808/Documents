<div></div><h1 data-label="249401" class="ltx_title_section">Results and Discussion</h1><div>The daily&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(UVI_{\max}\)</span> were selected in the time interval 11:00 h-14:00 h LT from all ground-based measurements over MCMA. A counter as an extension of the code was executed, to quantify these maximum values and the percentage of the days in the period 2000-2019. The results indicated that, from a total of 7,305 days of continuous measurements,&nbsp;the daily&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(UVI_{max}\)</span> reached values between 6 and 9 the 62.37% of the days (Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{929259}</span>). The highest UV Index values were in the 13-14 range, being their total percentage frequency less than 1%.</div>
