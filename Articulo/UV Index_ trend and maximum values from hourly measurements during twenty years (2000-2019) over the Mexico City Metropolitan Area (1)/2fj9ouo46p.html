<div> influences in the&nbsp; UVI at ground-level, was select the higher&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(UVI_{\max}\)</span> upon all network. From hourly measurements at each station, the predominant maximum of each hour was selected and the sequence was repeated along twenty years. The&nbsp;<code>Python</code> algorithm build an annual array with the higher&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(UVI_{\max}\)</span>&nbsp;sorted by month and day. The result for the compilation of the&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(UVI_{\max}\)</span>&nbsp;is illustrated in Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{931769}</span>.&nbsp;It can be seen that&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(UVI_{\max}\ge8\ \)</span> is more frequent at solar noon, such as it was anticipated for each station counted in Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{929259}</span>.&nbsp;</div>
