<div>In general, the exposure time to accumulate 1 MED in winter are larger than in summer and in the same way, are shorter at noon than in the morning or in the afternoon. The SIMA publishes a recommendation of protection according to the measured UVI. The system updates the webpage every 10 minutes with measured values. In this way, it would be more convenient to estimate the limit to the exposure time, in term of UV Index. We made a careful filtering of UV Index measurements, minute by minute in cloudless days, during the period 2016-2018. The selection was the scheme to determine the solar exposure time to acquire the erythemal doses for the skin types III and IV.</div>
