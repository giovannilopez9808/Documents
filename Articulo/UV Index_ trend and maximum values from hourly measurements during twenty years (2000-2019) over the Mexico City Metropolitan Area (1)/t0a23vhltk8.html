<div>a percentage of the mexican population still unknown the harmful effects of prolonged exposure under sun rays&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{2006}</cite>.&nbsp; The phototypes have a tolerance dose (or MED) determined in terms of SED, this aditional information should be accompagned UV Index data in line to demystified the perception about the darker skins can not have sunburn or worse yet, that they are exempt to develope skin-cancer. The skin of Mexican habitants derive from a wide mixing of ethnic groups. In multiple studies, notions about the variety of skin colors are often associated in terms of&nbsp;  'the race', 'ethnic skin' or 'Hispanic skin'&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Robinson_2017,Del_Bino_2013,2005}</cite>. Terminology to describe the origin, such as: Latinos of Mexican heritage, Mexican-American, Latin American or Hispanic involves a genetic back-ground, cultural traditions&nbsp;and customs, that would dictate a degree of caution for the people who would otherwise, based on appearance alone, would be classified&nbsp;as of sensitivity low-risk&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{de_Vries_2016,Wolbarsht1999,Lancer1998,Del_Bino_2013}</cite>. Nonetheless, these labels may accentuate the problem of an inadequate generalization. For example, Latinos from Latin America or the Caribbean Islands have&nbsp;darker skin and are even more genetically diverse than Mexican Americans&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Cuevas_2016,Marcheco_Teruel_2014}</cite>. A study carried out in the City of Chicago with a Latino population showed that the proportion measured for a light skin type was higher than what is commonly perceived and showed that many Latinos do have sun-sensitivity on the skin&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Robinson_2017}</cite>. In contrast, a specific publication about this topic concluded that “skin color” is a term and a concept that is relevant to cutaneous biology and disease research, independent of racial background&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Torres_2017}</cite>.&nbsp; This argument supports our choice by the Fitzpatrick convention, excluding<b>&nbsp;</b>ethnic terminology to calculate the erythemic dose thresholds (<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(H_{er}\)</span>) as function of time for each skin type (Table 1).&nbsp;</div><div>Regarding to the skin colors, the last edition of the National Survey About Discrimination (ENADIS) in colaboration with CONAPRED&nbsp;(Mexico's National Bureau for Prevention of Discrimination), INEGI&nbsp;(Mexico's National Institute of Statistics), CONACyT (National Council of Science and Technology)&nbsp;and CNDH (National Human Rights Commission, Mexico) used the methodology of the PERLA (Latin American Race and Ethnicity Project), that consisted in collecting data related to skin color of the mexican population on a palette of 11 colors&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{conacyt2010}</cite>. An adaptation reported&nbsp;skin type percentages was correlated with the phototypes I to VI. This correlation is displayed in Table 1. Since the largest fraction (83.2%) of the people have phototypes have phototype in the range III and IV&nbsp; in Mexico City, we considered these types as representative to calculate the maximum exposure times to avoid sunburn.&nbsp;</div>
