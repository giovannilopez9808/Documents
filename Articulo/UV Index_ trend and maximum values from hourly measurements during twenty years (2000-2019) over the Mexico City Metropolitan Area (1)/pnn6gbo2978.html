<div> To compare the ground-base measurements at solar noon, the UV Index measured by OMI-Aura/NIVR-FMI-NASA were mapped. Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{674611}</span>&nbsp;represents  the satellite UV Index data from 2005 to 2019 (there was no previous data in the analyzed period). As can be seen, the levels are higher than the monthly averages shown in Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{443547}</span>&nbsp;(where the UVI maximum values barely exceed 11). From the&nbsp;middle&nbsp;of January to mid-November, the satellite UV Index varies from 8 up to about 15 (<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(UVI_{\max}=14.9\)</span>). In particular, values equal or larger  than 11, corresponding to the<i> Extreme</i> qualification for the UV index given by WHO, are commons  from April to September.</div>
