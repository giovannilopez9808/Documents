<div>The  comparison of the&nbsp;\(UVI_{\max}\) in situ with the satellite retrievals revealed that exists a quite large similarity between them at solar noon. However, the results suggest that satellite data estimate may be biased to low values. The most noticeable difference is on December, when the  the&nbsp;\(UVI_{\max}\) in situ are between 8-11 and satellite data ranging from 6 to 8.&nbsp;</div><div>For the purpose to characterize the reached maximum, a screening process was carried out to the ground measurement values under cloudless sky. Currently, to implement a systematic method to filter the measurements with interference of clouds, are a challenge in the area.&nbsp;In spite of the lack of information about clouds presence during the day,  the data acquired each minute in the period 2016-2018 were a great identification tool. The measurements behavior minute by minute was used to recognize the clear sky day. As expected, the monthly averages UV Index under cloudless sky were higher than&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\overline{UVI}_m\)</span>, probably due to the clouds absence.</div>
