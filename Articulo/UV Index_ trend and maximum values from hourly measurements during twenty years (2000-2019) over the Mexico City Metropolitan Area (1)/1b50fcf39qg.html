<div> is fundamental for understanding of the UV Index levels.  Total&nbsp;Ozone&nbsp;Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) on board an Earth Probe (EP) from NASA, is the satellite instrument retrieving&nbsp; the Total Ozone Column (TOC) from spectral UV measurements. The 1,461 observations from TOMS-EP/NASA was used the years 2000 to 2003 and OMI-Aura/NIVR-FMI-NASA data from 2004 to 2019, both dataset covering the complete time series of the ground-measurements.&nbsp;Regarding of the dry period (December to March) can found the lowest density of clouds as well as the lowest ozone columns. Conversely, the abundant ozone levels take place from April to September.&nbsp;</div>
