<div> The available data set is rather larger, spanning two full decades for 5 stations and many years for the others, and with a measurement frequency of about 1 minute, thus resulting in ca. 2 million data points.  Accordingly, significant averaging was carried out to highlight the main features of the data.</div><h2 data-label="677253" class="ltx_title_subsection">Satellite data</h2><div>Satellite measurements of the Radiative Cloud Factor, the Total Ozone Column (TOC) and UV Index were used for the current study. These data were provided by the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI)&nbsp;on board of  AURA-NASA satellite and the Total&nbsp;Ozone&nbsp;Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) on board the Earth Probe (EP)-NASA satellite. OMI was created in a cooperation between the Netherlands Agency for Aerospace Programmes (NIVR), the Finnish Meteorological Institute (FMI) and NASA.  OMI (hereafter  OMI-Aura/NIVR-FMI-NASA) performs observations over a geographical dimension of 13 Ã— 24km<sup>2</sup> at nadir. For Mexico City, the satellite overpass time is between 19:00h - 21:00h UTC and data are specific for the coordinates and elevation of Mexico City.  The TOMS-EP/NASA satellite instrument was also considered to complete the  examined period. It is a version that precedes  OMI and it was retrieving&nbsp; the TOC from spectral UV measurements. &nbsp;</div><h1 data-label="833220" class="ltx_title_section">Measurements analysis</h1><div><i>Criteria pollutants</i><span>: Ground-based measurements of PM</span><sub>10</sub><span>, CO, O</span><sub>3</sub><span> and NO</span><sub>2</sub><span> from 11h to 14h CST&nbsp;were&nbsp;</span> extracted from the SIMAT data<span>&nbsp;to compute the daily averages at solar noon and the absolute maximums.</span></div><div><i>Aerosol Optical Depth:</i> The&nbsp;AERONET  Aerosol Optical Depth at 340 nm (AOD<sub>340</sub>) data Product Level 2.0 were selected.

The Cloud Factor is dimensionless, from 0 to 1 for the cloudless days and overcast sky, respectively. TOC data were obtained from TOMS-EP/NASA. The 1461 observations were acquired of the: TOMS-EP/NASA instrument during the period 2000 to 2003 and OMI-Aura/NIVR-FMI-NASA data from 2004 to 2019, both dataset covering the complete time series of the ground-UV Index measurements.</div><div><i>UV Index:&nbsp;</i>We developed a general code in&nbsp;<code>Python</code> to process the hourly averaged UV Index, 24 hours per day, 365 days a year, along two decades. Hereinafter, we refer to hourly averages simply as UV Index unless otherwise specified. The script also identifies the maximum UV index and ignores empty spaces and invalid values, product of the maintenance of the equipment. The algorithm creates a matrix with the maximum UV Index (<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(UVI_{\max}\)</span>) values sorted by date, hour and years. It selects the highest UV Index values of the network and a counter as an extension of the code was executed to quantify the values and their percentage frequency during 2000-2019 period. Thereupon it also calculates the hourly, monthly and annual averages. In particular,  the values from 11h to 14h CST&nbsp;were isolated to compute the daily averages around solar noon and the absolute maximums. For the UV Index  calculated from OMI-Aura/NIVR-FMI-NASA, we take into account all available daily values in the period 2000-2019 under the same specification of the Cloud Factor and TOC data.</div><h1 data-label="249401" class="ltx_title_section">Results and Discussion</h1><div>The daily&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(UVI_{\max}\)</span> were selected in the time interval 11:00 h-14:00 h CST from all ground-based measurements over MCMA.
