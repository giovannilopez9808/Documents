<div>Based on ground measurements analysis under all sky conditions we make an assessment of the values reached around solar noon.&nbsp;From daily&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(UVI_{\max}\)</span>, the monthly averages  (<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\overline{UVI_m}\)</span>) and Standard Deviations (SD) were  calculated.&nbsp;The&nbsp;<code>Simple Moving Average</code> function from&nbsp;<code>Python</code> was applied by quarter and a linear fit along the two decades was determined (Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{443547}</span>a). The linear equation has a slope&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(m_{UVI}\)</span>&nbsp;of 0.06 per year and the y-intercept (year 2000) has a UVI value of 8.5. For the sake of representing an annual behavior, the average, the median, SD,  maximum and minimum of the UV Index were obtained (Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{443547}</span>b). The maximum and minimum monthly mean of the UV Index were 10.6 (in May) and 6.5 (in November), respectively.</div>
