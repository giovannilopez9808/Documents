<div>Base on measurements analysis under all sky conditions we make an assessment the values typically reached around solar noon.&nbsp;From daily&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(UVI_{\max}\)</span>, the monthly averages  (<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\overline{UVI_m}\)</span>) and Standard Deviations (SD) were  calculated.&nbsp;The&nbsp;<code>Simple Moving Average</code> function from&nbsp;<code>Python</code>was applied on monthly by quaters and a linear fit along twenty years (Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{443547}</span>a). The linear equation had a slope&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(m_{UVI}\)</span>&nbsp;of 0.06 and 8.5 is the y-intercept. For the sake of simplify a annual behavior, the average, the median and SD, the maximum and minimum of the UV Index were obtained (Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{443547}</span>b).</div>
