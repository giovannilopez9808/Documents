<h1 data-label="874460" class="ltx_title_section">Introduction</h1><div>Mexico City is the largest city in North America by number of inhabitants  and one of the largest urban agglomeration in the world&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{2014a}</cite>. The latitude and longitude coordinates for the city are 19.4°N and 99.1°W, at an average height of 2240 meters above sea level. The Mexico City Metropolitan Area (MCMA) is surrounded by mountain ridges  exceeding 5000 m asl and has been the subject of multiples studies related to air quality due to intense anthropogenic activity&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{coauthors1998,Molina_2007,Molina_2010,Tzompa_Sosa_2017}</cite>. The complex topography and thermal inversions inhibit winds that sweep away pollution and influence the surface energy balance&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Whiteman_2000,juregui-ostos2005,Zhang_2009}</cite>. Solar radiation  varies along the hours of the day and the days of the year, as well as via its dependence of atmospheric components that attenuate the different wavelengths. The ultraviolet (UV) range is only a small part of total incident irradiance, but plays a key role in atmospheric photochemistry&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{LEIGHTON_1961,pandis2016}</cite>. On the pathway through the atmosphere, photons experience scattering by air molecules, aerosol particles (haze) and clouds, as well as absorption by gases such as ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) and nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), and some aerosols.  An increase in ozone concentration in polluted boundary layers is also generated by strong UV photon fluxes interacting with anthropogenic precursor emissions&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{LEIGHTON_1961,Finlayson_Pitts_2000}</cite>. Conversely, aerosols may increase or reduce the insolation and photolysis rates, and thus affect photochemical smog formation&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Dickerson_1997}</cite>. A modelization of&nbsp;actinic flux applied to Mexico City, showed a decrease at the surface and an increase aloft, mainly due to the presence of aerosols&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Palancar_2012}</cite>. Likewise, a reduction in the&nbsp; measured and theoretical values of nitrogen dioxide photolysis rate  was attributed to attenuation of spectral actinic solar flux by aerosols&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Castro_2001}</cite>.&nbsp;</div><div>Despite multiple efforts to monitor and characterize air quality in the Mexico City basin, few studies have specially focused  on global solar radiation&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{valdes1991,Qui_ones_2014,Matsumoto_2014}</cite>. In the mid-1990s, two studies about UV solar irradiance measurements  in the Mexican Valley, for periods shorter than 3 years, were published. One of these studies suggested&nbsp;a significant attenuation on UV intensity due to tropospheric ozone, comparing measurements in downtown and outskirts of the Mexico City&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Acosta_2000}</cite>. Another study reported that Mexico City had lower ultraviolet fluxes (around 25% at noon and 50% in the afternoon) compared to Colima, a city placed at the same latitude, lower elevation (ca. 300-500 m asl) and almost pollution-free.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Galindo_1995}</cite>.   To our knowledge, these are the only published long-term measurements of UV radiation in Mexico City.  Short-term measurements and comparisons with radiative models were reported by&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Palancar_2012}</cite>.  Other UV measurements have been carried out to estimate aerosol optical properties at UV wavelengths, e.g. using UV Multi-Filter Rotating Shadowband Radiometers (MFRSRs) to estimate aerosol single scattering albedo&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Goering_2005,Corr_2009}</cite>, but did not focus on the UV Index. &nbsp;</div>
