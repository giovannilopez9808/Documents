<div>Since the measurements&nbsp;minute by minute shown in Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{358425}</span>&nbsp;were carried out under clear sky conditions, it is possible that the difference may be attributed to aerosol variations. The UV Index  for four dates in each seasons were an example of&nbsp;the largest percentage relative difference at solar noon is shows in autumn with value of 13.35 % between CHO (outskirts) and SFE (in Mexico City) stations (see Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{547698}</span>). Regardless of the&nbsp;season, UV Index measurements nearby solar noon in each station begin to be separate from each other and&nbsp;tend to be lower in some  regions (and consequently at stations)&nbsp;far away  to  anthropogenic activity.</div>
