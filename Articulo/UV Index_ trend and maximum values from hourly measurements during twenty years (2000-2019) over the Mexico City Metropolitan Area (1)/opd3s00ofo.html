<div>. An increasing of the surface ozone concentration is also generated by a strong UV photon flux interacting with anthropogenic precursor emissions&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Lei_2007}</cite>. On the another hand, aerosols may reduce the insolation and inhibit the photolysis rate due to smog formation&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Dickerson_1997}</cite>. A modelization of&nbsp;actinic flux applied to Mexico City, showed a decrease mainly due to the aerosol presence&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Palancar_2012}</cite>. Likewise, a reduction in the theoretical values of nitrogen dioxide photolysis rate  was also associated to spectral actinic solar flux&nbsp;attenuated by aerosols&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Castro_2001}</cite>. Consequently, UV irradiance provides plenty information about the atmospheric components that attenuates this irradiance.&nbsp;</div><div>In spite of multiple efforts to monitor and characterize the air quality in the whole Mexico City basin, few studies have specially focused  on global solar radiation&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Qui_ones_2014,Matsumoto_2014,valdes1991}</cite>. In the mid-1990s, two studies about UV solar irradiance measurements  in the Mexican Valley in periods shorter than 3 years were published. One of them suggested&nbsp;a significant attenuation on UV intensity due to tropospheric ozone, comparing measurements in downtown and outskirts of the Mexico City&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Acosta_2000}</cite>. Other study reported a reduction on UV radiation flux (around 25.6% at noon and 50% in the afternoon) lower than in Colima, a pollution-free city  in the same latitude of the Mexico City&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Galindo_1995}</cite>.  Up to now,  these works have been the only ones carried out  in this topic in the MCMA.</div>
