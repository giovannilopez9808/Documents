Since the year 2000, the biometers installed in the weather stations network of SIMAT have been measuring erythemally-weighted UV solar radiation (MED/hr). Although at the beginning only a few stations operated with these sensors, currently 11 stations are recording solar erythemal irradiance, which multiplied by a factor are converted to UV Index. The instruments Model 501A were manufactured by Solar Light Company and the calibrations were carried out every year&nbsp;using a reference sensor of the same factory. The localization of the radiometers in each station conforming the network is described in Table 1.</div>
