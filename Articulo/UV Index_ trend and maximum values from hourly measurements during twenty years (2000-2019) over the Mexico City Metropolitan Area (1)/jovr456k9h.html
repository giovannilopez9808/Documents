<div>f wavelength. Ultraviolet (UV) range is only a small part of total incident irradiance and plays a key role in atmospheric photochemistry&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Logan_1981,Brasseur_1998}</cite>.&nbsp;UV radiation on the pathway through atmosphere is affected by gaseous absorbers mainly the ozone as well as NO<sub>2</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub>. An increasing of the surface ozone concentration is also generated by a strong UV photon flux interacting with anthropogenic precursor emissions&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Lei_2007}</cite>. On the another hand, the aerosols may reduce the insolation and inhibit the photolysis rate for smog formation&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Dickerson_1997}</cite>. A modelization of&nbsp;actinic flux applied to Mexico City, showed a decrease mainly due to the aerosol presence&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Palancar_2012}</cite>. Likewise, a reductiong in the theoretical values of nitrogen dioxide photolysis rate  was also associated to spectral actinic solar flux&nbsp;attenuated by aerosols&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Castro_2001}</cite>. That is why UV irradiance provides plenty information about the atmospheric components that attenuates this irradiance.&nbsp;</div><div>In spite of multiples efforts to monitor and characterize the climatology in whole basin, few studies have specially focused  on global solar radiation&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Qui_ones_2014,Matsumoto_2014,valdes1991}</cite>. In the mid-1990s, two studies about UV solar irradiance measurements  in the Mexican Valley in periods shorter than 3 year were published. One of them suggested&nbsp;a significant attenuation on UV intensity due to tropospheric ozone, comparing measurements in downtown and outskirts of the Mexico City&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Acosta_2000}</cite>. Another authors reported a reduction on UV radiation flux (around 25.6% at noon and 50% in the afternoon) was lower than in Colima, a pollution-free city  in the same latitude&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Galindo_1995}</cite>.  Up to now, these works have been the only exclusively ones carried out  in this topic in the MCMA, despite there is a vast scientific literature about UV irradiance that has contributed to knowledge the global climatology&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Luccini_2006,Herman_1999,Kalliskota_2000,Madronich_1993,Herman_2010}</cite>. Even more, there is no investigations about UV Index behavior along the time in this megacity.</div>
