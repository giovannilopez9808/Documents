<div> The UVI derived from satellite observations is seen to be systematically larger than the mean UVI values measured at the ground.  This is to some extent expected, since satellites fail to resolve local clouds and aerosols, particularly near surface levels.  To examine this over-estimation in more detail, we selected a subset of the ground-based data that included only the maximum value from all stations and all years of measurement, for each hour and day of the year. The result for the compilation of this&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(UVI_{\max}\)</span>&nbsp;is illustrated in Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{931769}</span>.&nbsp;It can be seen that&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(UVI_{\max}\ge8\ \)</span> is very frequent at solar noon, as  was seen in  Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{929259}</span>, corresponding to the daily maximum near noon. The highest&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(UVI_{\max}\)</span> recorded in the period 2000-2019 was 14.9, which is consistent with the maximum values obtained from satellite observations.   </div>
