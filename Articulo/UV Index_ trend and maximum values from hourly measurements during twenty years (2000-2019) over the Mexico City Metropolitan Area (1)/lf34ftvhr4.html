<div>The monthly UV Index values may be rather low as consequence of the averaging of measurements in presence of clouds or atmospheric pollution.&nbsp;Policies aimed on the improvement of air quality simultaneously with urban and industrial development have taken place in the last years&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{figueroa2009}</cite>. It was also established that, besides urban aerosol pollution sources, biomass burning  from agricultural, forest, wood cooking and trash burning, also contributes to the pollution in the MCMA&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Parrish_2011}</cite>. Stephens et al (2008) determined the monthly variation of the concentrations of PM<sub>10</sub> in the morning (between 7h and 12h) and O<sub>3</sub> in the afternoon (from 11h to 17h) for the years 2001–2007. The mean values were: 81 µg/m<sup>3</sup> for PM<sub>10</sub> and 83 ppb for O<sub>3&nbsp;</sub><cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Stephens_2008}</cite>. </div>
