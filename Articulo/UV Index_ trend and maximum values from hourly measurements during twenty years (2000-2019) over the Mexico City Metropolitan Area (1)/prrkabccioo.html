<div>The upper and lower wide curves are associated to measurements carried out in summer and winter seasons and the areas contain the exposure times between spring and autumn. The asymptote at 15h CTS represents that it will not be possible to achieve the MED after this hour. The representation along the hours shows that the exposure time range was narrower, since in this case only clear sky measurements we considered.</div><h1 data-label="507127" class="ltx_title_section">Conclusion</h1><div>The aim of this study was characterize the UV Index reached over Mexico City Metropolitan Area in the last 20 years. The location of this megacity is in a region prone to achieve high values of UV Index&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Tanskanen_2006,Zaratti_2014}</cite>. In spite of Mexico City high altitude (2240 m asl) the ultraviolet irradiance is lower than in Colima (485 m asl), a relatively pollution-free city and placed  at&nbsp;about   the same latitude&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Galindo_1995}</cite>. The&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\overline{UVI}_m\)</span>&nbsp;at solar noon reaches up to 10.6 obtained under all sky conditions (see Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{443547}</span>). In contrast, the highest&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(UVI_{\max}\)</span>&nbsp;value from satellite data was 14.8 (Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{674611}</span>) and the ground-based value was 14.9 (in Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{931769}</span>), both in<i> Extreme</i> qualification range of WHO&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{2002}</cite>. The high aerosols concentration and smog photochemistry products may affect the solar radiation reaching the surface&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Castro_2001,Palancar_2012}</cite>.  Also the existence of cloud coverage almost all year round can be partially responsible for the  not as high as expected UV index values for Mexico city. In the period 2000-2019 the criteria pollutants trends:&nbsp;PM<sub>10</sub>, CO, NO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub> and AOD<sub>340&nbsp;</sub>&nbsp;were negatives. However the&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\overline{UVI}_m\)</span>&nbsp;at solar noon under all sky conditions are in the<i>&nbsp;High, Very High and Extreme</i>&nbsp;ranges  (<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\overline{UVI}\ \ge6\)</span>) during all months of the year (see Figures&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{443547}</span>,&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{674611}</span> and&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{931769}</span>). The few articles existing about solar radiation in this city have either been short-term studies or have not focused on UV irradiance affecting health skin. In this work, a code in&nbsp;<code>Python</code>&nbsp;was created to analyze the complete database at different scales of time (minute, hours, days and years) calculating the averages and the maximums UV Index as well and its trend. One part of the script was extended to the management and determination of the exposure times corresponding&nbsp; to the threshold erythemal dose. The levels of UV Index at noon in the period 2000&nbsp;to 2019 over MCMA show a trend of 0.66 % per year with respect to the mean.&nbsp;This trend is within the range of the results published by Herman (2010) about erythemal irradiance trend from 1979 to 2008 derived from satellite data (between -1.7% to 2.0% annually) in the latitudinal range of  Mexico City. The current study also contributes to the determination of the solar exposure time as a limit to avoid sunburn, considering the phototypes more frequent of the inhabitants of the Mexico City. Regarding to skin color to define the sensibility, imprecise terminology such as 'ethnic skin' and 'Hispanic skin' accentuates the problem of sparse data and hides relevant characteristics. There are discrepancies between the MED values defined for each phototype&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Fitzpatrick1988,Sanclemente_2008,Pérez2014,Lehmann_2019,Cadet_2019}</cite>. The definition of the colors gradient and the descriptive numbers associated to the phototypes should always be clear and specific. An essential element is assuming ethnic diversity. The  threshold erythemal dose for each phototype is fundamental to awareness of the photoprotection. The photoprotection needs to be promoted with properly communication about the risk and skin care. This premise would help to demystify the perception about the fact that the darker skins can not have sunburn or are exempt to develop skin-cancer&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{b2006}</cite>. Prevention and timely diagnosis continue to be the main strategy to reduce the incidence and impact of skin cancer&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Pinedo_2009,a2016}</cite>. This study highlights the importance of knowing the UV Index levels and the maximum exposure times to avoid damage. The government advice may be accompanied by recommendations  associated with typical customs of the country, such as the use of hats and long-sleeved shirts when they work or perform recreational activities in outdoors conditions.&nbsp;</div><h1 data-label="667124" class="ltx_title_section">Acknowledgements</h1><div>We wish to acknowledge the SEDEMA members, institution that belongs to the Mexico City Government.
