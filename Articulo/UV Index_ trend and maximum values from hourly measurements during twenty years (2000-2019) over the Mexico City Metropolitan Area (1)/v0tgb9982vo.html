<div>Some reports have indicated that the outdoor workers receive between 10% and 80% of ambient UV radiation<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Lark√∂1983,Makgabutlane_2015,Silva_2016}</cite>. In MCMA are living more than 21 million persons, a large fraction exposed to solar radiation. In this intertropical zone there is a wide daylight window almost all year, so that the UV Index is a useful and indispensable reference to prevent unwanted skin exposure. The assessments of the UV irradiance contribute to the knowledge of the regional climatology as well as the global monitoring of the atmosphere&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Luccini_2006,Kalliskota_2000,Madronich_1993,Herman_2010,Fioletov_2004,Staiger_2005}</cite>. Likewise, a lot of scientific publications around the world describe the importance of understanding the UV irradiance behavior along the time and its relation with the MED&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Parra_2019,Cadet_2019,RIVAS_2015,Calaf_2011,Lehmann_2019}</cite>. Despite of the relevance of UVI as a communication tool in relation to the public health, at present there are no studies focused on the maximum values attained and its behavior in Mexico City. The aim of this work is to analyze twenty years of UV Index measurements over MCMA to determine: averages and maximum values as well as values filtered under cloudless sky. Finally,  the SED/hr is calculated to quantify the solar exposure times to accumulate&nbsp;the&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(H_{er}\)</span>&nbsp;for 1 MED on skin phototype III and IV.</div>
