<div>For assessing the influence of the aerosols and criteria pollutants in the UV Index, we processed the PM<sub>10</sub>, CO, NO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;and AOD<sub>340</sub> ground-based measurements carried out at the stations mentioned in Table 2. From daily measurements from 11h to 14h CST the annual mean of PM<sub>10</sub>, CO, NO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub> were calculated. For the case of the AOD<sub>340</sub>, the measurements along of the day were averaged. Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{610674}</span><span> shows the trends of the annual values from 2000 to 2019. On the other hand, to estimate the  percentage&nbsp;change per year (</span><span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\epsilon\left(\%\right)\)</span>), the slope (<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(m_ {X}\)</span>) of&nbsp; the linear fit and the average&nbsp;in all period  (<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\overline{X}_{2000-2019}\)</span>) were used. In the case of the UVI percentage&nbsp;change was 0.66 % per year. In the same way, Table 3 shows the values corresponding to   PM<sub>10</sub>, CO, NO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub> and AOD<sub>340</sub>.&nbsp;</div>
