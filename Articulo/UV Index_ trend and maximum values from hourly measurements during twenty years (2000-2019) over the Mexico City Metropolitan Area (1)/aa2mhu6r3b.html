<div>As it was expected, monthly average UV Index values have a significant dispersion due to the considered cloudy days (Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{443547}</span>) for all sky conditions.&nbsp;  There is a lack in ground-base information about sky conditions. Afterwards, we have measurements minute by minute in the period 2016-2018 and it was possible to filter only measurements under cloudless sky. Currently, it is still a challenge area to define an optimal cloud filter to isolate the data at the attenuation moment and take into account the rest of values for the statistical analysis.&nbsp;</div><div>In general, the exposure time to accumulate 1 MED in winter are larger than in summer and in the same way, are shorter at noon than in the morning or in the afternoon. The SIMAT publishes a recommendation of protection according to the measured UVI. The system updates the webpage every 10 minutes with measured values. In this way, it would be more convenient to estimate the limit to the exposure time, in term of UV Index. We made a careful filtering of UV Index measurements, minute by minute in cloudless days, during the period 2016-2018. The selection was the scheme to determine the solar exposure time to acquire the erythemal doses for the skin types III and IV.</div>
