The&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(H_{er}\)</span>&nbsp;value, when applied to each skin phototype,&nbsp;predicts the appearance of erythema some hours after exposure.

This&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(H_{er}\)</span>value to produce erythema was established as the Minimal Erythemal Dose (MED), which has been widely used as a primary and preventive&nbsp;measure  of skin damage. Several studies have examined values of MED for different skin phototypes&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{MacKie_2000,Meinhardt2008,Miller2012}</cite>. CIE proposed the Standard Erythemal Dose (SED) with a value of 100 J/m<sup>2&nbsp;</sup>as an erythemally weighted unit dose, independent of skin phototype&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{organization2014}</cite>. So,&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(H_{er}\)</span>&nbsp;can be calculated for each skin phototype, in units of SEDs. The lowest values of the MED ranges defined by Fitzpatrick under UVB radiation for each phototype, are taken as reference in this work (see Table 1,&nbsp;&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Fitzpatrick1988}</cite>).</div><div>Skin cancer is one of the most damaging effects of long-term solar exposure and is very common in most regions the world, according to the World Health Organization&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{2002}</cite>.&nbsp;In Mexico, the incidence is probably under-reported since the majority of skin cancers are not cause of death&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{jm2011}</cite>.
