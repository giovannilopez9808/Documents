<div>In order to assess the air quality, we processed the measurements made with ground-based instruments in the same stations where UV Index was recorded. To recognize the individual contributions of PM<sub>10</sub>, CO, NO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;were calculated the annual averages base on daily measurements from 11h to 14h LT in the period 2000-2019. The trends determined from de linear fit are:&nbsp;-0.1196%/year, -0.8575 %/year,&nbsp;&nbsp;-1.04,&nbsp;-1.046 to&nbsp;PM<sub>10</sub>, CO, NO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;respectively.</div>
