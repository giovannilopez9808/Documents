<div>UV Index (UVI) is an indicator related to the intensity of the solar UV  radiation at the Earth’s surface and&nbsp;the risk for persons to suffer sunburn,&nbsp;and may be relevant to chronic effects  due to prolonged exposure, such as skin cancer.  Fitzpatrick classification defines six phototypes (I-VI) or skin colors from pale to dark, correlated to the UV radiation sensitivity&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{kukita1974}</cite>. The International Commission on Illumination (CIE) established an action spectrum for erythema (or erithemic sensitivity) of the human skin&nbsp;using phototype II&nbsp;from Fitzpatrick classification&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{organization2014}</cite>. According to the World Health Organization (WHO)  the UVI is expressed mathematically as follows:<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\[UVI=k_{er}\int_{250nm}^{400nm}E(\lambda,t)\cdot S_{er}\left(\lambda\right)d\lambda\]</span></div><div>where<i>&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(E\left(\lambda,t\right)\)</span></i> is the solar spectral irradiance in units of W/(m<sup>2</sup> ·nm),&nbsp;<i>&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(S_{er}\left(\lambda\right)\)</span></i> is the erithemic sensitivity defined by CIE and&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(k_{er}\)</span> is a factor equal to 40&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>/W. The WHO standarized the UVI scale as: low (0, 1 and 2), moderate (3, 4 and 5), high (6 and 7), very high (8, 9 and 10) and extreme (11 or more)&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{2002}</cite>. Even values of UVI above 20 have been recorded in La Quiaca, Argentina&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Cede_2002}</cite>.&nbsp;An extended recommendation of the WHO version is unfolding UVI values larger than 11 and modifying the color scale&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Zaratti_2014}</cite>. This suggestion could be appropriate for the Mexico City due to UVI reaching values considered as high, almost all year in this latitudinal band&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Tanskanen_2006,Herman_2010}</cite>. The skin reddening (or&nbsp;erythema, as a sign of possible sunburn or even more complicated skin diseases&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{kukita1974}</cite>) caused by solar radiation depends on&nbsp; intensity of the source, skin phototype and exposure time. For an interval time&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\((t_2-t_1)\)</span> the&nbsp;erythemal dose or erythemal radiant exposure&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Braslavsky_2007}</cite> is calculated as:</div>
