<div>Many people spend time under the sun rays on recreational activities without proper protection. Particularly, the people working outdoors conditions have risks of suffer the solar overexposure. Some reports have indicated that the workers receive between 10% and 80% of ambient UV radiation<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Lark√∂1983,Makgabutlane_2015,Silva_2016}</cite>. In MCMA living more than 21 million population exposing to solar radiation. In this intertropical zone there is a wide daylight window almost all year, being the UV Index an useful and indispensable reference to prevent the population of unwanted effects. The assessments of the UV irradiance contribute to knowledge of the regional climatology as well as the global monitoring of the atmosphere<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Luccini_2006,Fioletov_2004,Staiger_2005}</cite>.&nbsp; Likewise, a lot of scientific publications around the world describe the importance of understanding of UV irradiance behavior along the time and the relationship with SED or MED<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Parra_2019,Cadet_2019,RIVAS_2015,Calaf_2011,Lehmann_2019}</cite>. Despite of the relevance of UVI as communication tool in the public health, at present there are no studies focused on the maximum values attained in Mexico City and its implications. The aim of this work is analyse twenty years of a large set of UV Index measurements over MCMA and quantifying the solar exposure times along of the day that accumulate&nbsp; the&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(H_{er}\)</span> equivalent to 1 MED for each skin phototype.</div>
