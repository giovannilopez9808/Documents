<div>At least in 5 stations, this daily systematic operation was carried out during two decades. The averages hourly UV Index (<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\overline{UVI}\)</span>) conform the 2,000,000 values synthesized from historical database.</div><h1 data-label="833220" class="ltx_title_section">Measurements analysis</h1><div>Main analysis was performed to identify the maximum UVI values measured&nbsp; over MCMA in the complete 2000-2019 period. We developed a&nbsp;<code>Python</code> script to process the data set. The algorithm collects  the information by station (<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(s\)</span>) and create an individial list with the elements: date day-month (<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(d\)</span>),  year (<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(y\)</span>), hour<i>&nbsp;(<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(i\)</span>)&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\overline{UVI}\)</span>. All the empty spaces are ignored in the calculation as well as invalid values product of maintenance of the equipments. A null array is initialized with fixed rows-columns size corresponding to average hourly UVI values, 24 hours per day, 365 days a year, for every year in the&nbsp;past two decades.  Thereby, daily&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\overline{UVI}\)</span>&nbsp;values were hourly compared with&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(i\)</span>from 0h to 23h for each date and station. Each position keeps a value into array and it was permuted by maximum value swiping all measurements over MCMA along years:</div><div><span class="math ltx_Math v1">\[\overline{UVI}_{i,d,y}^s\ \le\overline{UVI}_{i,d,y}^{s'}\ \to\overline{UVI}_{i,d}^{\max}\text{       in the period 2000-2019}\]</span></div><div>simultaneously applying to&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(i\)</span>,&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(d\)</span> and&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(y\)</span>&nbsp;the same values in both sides of inequality.
