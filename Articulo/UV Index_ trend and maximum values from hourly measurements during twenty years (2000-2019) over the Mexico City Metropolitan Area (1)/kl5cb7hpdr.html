<div>UV Index (UVI) is an indicator related to the intensity of the solar UV radiation at the Earth’s surface and&nbsp;the risk of suffer sunburn&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Madronich_1997}</cite>.  Fitzpatrick classification is conform by six phototypes or skin colors (from pale to dark) correlating the&nbsp;UV radiation sensitivity&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{kukita1974}</cite>. The International Commission on Illumination (CIE) established an action spectrum for erythema (or erithemic sensitivity) of the human skin&nbsp;using the phototype II&nbsp;from Fitzpatrick classification&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{organization2014}</cite>. According to the World Health Organization (WHO)  the UVI can be calculated by the following formula:<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\[UVI=k_{er}\int_{250nm}^{400nm}E(\lambda,t)\cdot S_{er}\left(\lambda\right)d\lambda\]</span></div><div>where<i>&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(E\left(\lambda,t\right)\)</span></i> is the solar spectral irradiance in units of W/(m<sup>2</sup> ·nm),&nbsp;<i>&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(S_{er}\left(\lambda\right)\)</span></i> is the erithemic sensitivity defined by the CIE and&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(k_{er}\)</span>is a factor equal to 40&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>/W. The WHO standarized the UVI scale as: low (0, 1 and 2), moderate (3, 4 and 5), high (6 and 7), very high (8, 9 and 10) and extreme (11 or more)&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{2002}</cite>.&nbsp;like La Quiaca, in North west of Argentina, arrives at 20 and even more</div>
