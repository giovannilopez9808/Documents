<div>There are few publications about the epidemiology of skin cancer produced by solar exposure in Latin America, and even fewer about incidence and mortality rates related to ethnic origin (see for instance&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{de_Vries_2016}</cite>).&nbsp;Notwithstanding the high UV Index  levels reported&nbsp;in other regions of the country&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{moscoso2012}</cite>, a percentage of the Mexican population still uninformed about the harmful effects of prolonged exposure under the sun&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{b2006}</cite>. Skin types in Mexico derive from wide mixing of ethnic groups. In multiple studies, notions about the variety of skin colors are often associated to 'race', 'ethnic skin' or 'Hispanic skin'&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{2005,Del_Bino_2013,Robinson_2017}</cite>. Terminology to describe the origin, such as: Latinos of Mexican heritage, Mexican-American, Latin American or Hispanic involves a genetic background, cultural traditions&nbsp;and customs, that would dictate a degree of caution for the people who would otherwise, based on nationality or appearance alone, would be classified&nbsp;as of low-risk sensitivity&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{de_Vries_2016,Wolbarsht1999,Lancer1998,Del_Bino_2013}</cite>. Nonetheless, these labels may accentuate the problem of inadequate generalization&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Cuevas_2016,Marcheco_Teruel_2014}</cite>. A specific publication about this topic concluded that “skin color” is a term and a concept that is relevant to cutaneous biology and disease research, independent of racial background&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Torres_2017}</cite>.&nbsp; This argument supports the choice of Fitzpatrick convention for this study, excluding<b>&nbsp;</b>ethnic terminology to calculate the erythemic dose thresholds (<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(H_{er}\)</span>) according to skin color.&nbsp;</div><div> Regarding to the skin appearance, the last edition of the National Survey About Discrimination (ENADIS) using the methodology of the PERLA (Latin American Race and Ethnicity Project), published information related to skin type of the Mexican population on a palette of 11 colors&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{conacyt2010}</cite>.  An adaptation of these skin colors grouped into Fitzpatrick phototypes and their respective percentages present in Mexican people, are displayed in Table 1. Since the largest fraction (83.2%) of the people has phototype in the color ranges III (24.0%) and IV (59.2%) in the country, we take into account these types as representative to calculate the maximum exposure times to avoid sunburn, of course with the understanding that paler colors require shorter times and darker ones need longer times to generate sunburn.</div>
