<div><span class="math ltx_Math v1">\[\frac{SED}{hr}=0.9UVI\]</span>As is indicated in Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{590688}</span>a, the interpolation of the UV Index (and corresponding SED/hr) at solar noon under clear sky, revels that these levels match better with the&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(UVI_{\max}\)</span> values measured over the network (see Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{931769}</span>) and the highest UV Index value of 12.6 (11.3 SED/hr) on June. Additionally, the SED/hr under all clear sky days were averaged for the three seasons: cold dry, warm dry and rainy, as is shown in Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{590688}</span>b. The warm dry and rainy seasons have a behavior almost coincident. Few data under clear sky were detected between September and October (part of the rainy season) being a negligible contribution on total average just when the UV Index decrease. Nevertheless, the daily asymmetries around solar noon shown in Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{358425}</span> could be caused by criteria gases and aerosol. An additional comparison between AOD ground-based measurements and derived data from model&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Castro_2001,Cabrera_2012,Palancar_2012}</cite>&nbsp;are needed to confirm this hypothesis.&nbsp; However, the main reason for the seasonal variation of the cloud-free UVI is not due to aerosols, but rather simply to the annual cycle of the solar zenith angle, the cosine of which is also plotted in Fig. <span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{590688}</span>a and is seen to correlate well with the UVI. &nbsp;</div>
