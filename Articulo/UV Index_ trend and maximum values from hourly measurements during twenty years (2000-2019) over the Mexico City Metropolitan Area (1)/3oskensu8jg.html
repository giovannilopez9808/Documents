<div>An advantage of boarding the complete database is to help makes a robust statistic about the ranges of maximum values for all sky conditions.&nbsp;For these values processed was determained an interpolation from averages and SD bands. As it was expected monthly UV Index values had a large dispersion due to climate, where cloudy days are frequent except to December-May. This effect can be predominantly reduced in warm-dry period (from March to May) where their SD and amplitude values were shorter than the rest of the year.&nbsp;</div><div>A fundamental issue is identify the impact of clouds on mean UV Index values.  However,&nbsp;a gap in our knowledge is discriminate cloudy days due to there is no ground-base information. Currently, it is still a challenge area define an optimal cloud filter to isolate the data at the attenuation moment and take into account the rest of values to the statistical analysis.&nbsp;</div><div>An alternative widely used is examine the Radiative Cloud Factor measurements from Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI). OMI was created in cooperation of the Netherlands Agency for Aerospace Programmes (NIVR), the Finnish Meteorological Institute (FMI) and the National Aeronautics and Space Agency (NASA). On board Aura satellite, OMI (hereafter  OMI-Aura/NIVR-FMI-NASA) performs observations over a dimension of 13 Ã— 24km<sup>2</sup> at nadir. For Mexico City, the satellite overpass time is between 19:00h - 21:00h UTC&nbsp;and the coordinates considering are Lat: 19.42,&nbsp; Lon: -99.12 and Alt: 2,245 m a.s.l. The Cloud Factor comes from dataset of OMTO3 v8.5, Collection 3 and L2 quality. The Cloud Factor (dimensionless ) is represented in scale from 0 to 1 for the cloudless days and overcast sky, respectively. In Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{573921}</span>a depicts the daily Cloud Factor (5,844 observations) recorded from 2004 to 2019 period.  It revealed that an extensive cloud cover in the months from May to November regularly appears within the rainy period, instead the clouds presence   was less frequent the rest of the year.&nbsp;</div><div>Moreover, incorporate satellital information about the ozone is fundamental for understanding of the UV Index levels.  Total&nbsp;Ozone&nbsp;Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) on board an Earth Probe (EP) from NASA, is the satellite instrument retrieving&nbsp; the Total Ozone Column (TOC) from spectral UV measurements. The 1,461 observations from TOMS-EP/NASA was used the years 2000 to 2003 and OMI-Aura/NIVR-FMI-NASA data from 2004 to 2019, both dataset covering the complete time series of the ground-measurements.&nbsp;Regarding of the dry period (December to March) can found the lowest density of clouds as well as the lowest ozone columns. Conversely, the abundant ozone levels take place from April to September.&nbsp;</div>
